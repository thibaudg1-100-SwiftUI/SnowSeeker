    // As you can see, that conforms to Identifiable so we can loop over an array of facilities with SwiftUI, and internally it looks up a given facility name in a dictionary to return the correct icon. Iâ€™ve picked out various SF Symbols icons that work well for the facilities we have, and I also used an accessibilityLabel() modifier for the image to make sure it works well in VoiceOver.
